			<h3>Mentoring & Teaching</h3>
			<p>I am currently a peer mentor at Texas A&M University. I mentor Aggie college student who are enrolled in the Texas 
				success initiative. I decided to become a peer mentor because I take pride and find joy in being able to help lead 
				others to success. I started as a peer mentor in Fall 2022 and have decided to continue with the program for as long 
				as I can. My role as a peer mentor revolves around aiding in my mentees success throughout their college lives. The 
				main focus is in their academics, however it is important to help with other problems that may arise, whether it be 
				social, emotional, or anything a college student can experience. There is a limit to how much we can help, however 
				we can also link them to resources that are available on campus and both in the city.

			<p>I have been a peer teacer for ENGR 102, a beginner python class, for a semester. I also plan on being a peer teacher
				for some computer science courses such as CSCE 121 (Introduction to Program Design and Concepts) and CSCE 222 
				(Data Structures and Algorithms). Being a peer teacher gives me the ability to help contribute to fellow aggies 
				learning and understanding of the courses they take. I specifically have interests in teaching programming related 
				because I can help with those topics the most and it gives me the chance to see how other people approach coding problems.

			<h3>Leadership</h3>
			<p>From Fall 2021 to Spring 2022 I was the Sports Chair of Texas A&M Chinese Student Association (CSA). By taking this role 
				I was given the chance to lead part of a large organization within my community. I find it fulfilling to take on 
				leadership roles, however I also took on this role to give back to the community that helped establish me at Texas 
				A&M University. My role in CSA was to keep the organization involved in intramural sports and to organize sporting events. 
				For intramurals, I would have to keep track of what sports to get involved in, create and organize teams for those sports, 
				and to help lead practices for them. Outside of the sports side of the role, I was also one of several officers within a 
				smaller group in the organization called a "houshold". A household would create social events and promote the well-being 
				of it's members by giving advice and holding study sessions.
